Model Derivative API:

The Model Derivative API enables users to represent and share their designs in different formats, as well as to extract valuable metadata. (Its translation functionality was previously bundled as part of the “View and Data API”.)

- Translate designs into SVF format for rendering in the Forge Viewer.

- Extract design metadata and integrate it into your app. Including object hierarchy trees, model views, and object properties, - such as materials, density and volume, etc.

- Extract selected parts of a design and export the set of geometries in OBJ format.

- Create different-sized thumbnails from design files.
  Translate designs into different formats, such as STL and OBJ.
